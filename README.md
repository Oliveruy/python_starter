This repository contains three simple Python scripts that perform different functions:

# BMI Calculator
The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator calculates the Body Mass Index based on user inputs of height and weight. It utilizes the standard BMI formula (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) to determine the BMI value.

To use the BMI Calculator:

Run the bmi_calculator.py script.
Enter your weight and height when prompted.
The script will display your calculated BMI.
## Tip Calculator
The Tip Calculator helps calculate the appropriate tip amount based on a specified percentage of the total bill. Users input the total bill amount and the desired tip percentage to receive the tip amount.

To use the Tip Calculator:

Run the tip_calculator.py script.
Enter the total bill amount.
Enter the desired tip percentage.
The script will output the calculated tip amount.
### Band Name Generator
The Band Name Generator generates unique band names by combining random words or elements provided by the user, such as the name of the user's hometown and the user's pet name.

To use the Band Name Generator:

Run the band_name_generator.py script.
Follow the prompts to input the requested details.
The script will generate a creative band name based on the provided inputs.
Each script is self-contained and can be executed individually to perform its specific task.
